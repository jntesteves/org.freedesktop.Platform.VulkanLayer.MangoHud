# MangoHUD 

## Configuration

MangoHud can be configured just like the [instructions](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud#hud-configuration) mentioned by the project, but you must give Flatpak apps access to the configuration files. That can be done with the following command:

```
flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/MangoHud:ro
```
